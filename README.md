Making a basic pick-and-stack robot simulation with Mujoco, using RRT for object avoidance.
RRT code credit to https://github.com/sjchoi86/yet-another-mujoco-tutorial-v3
TODO: 
- Ensure RRT collision avoidance includes grippers, and make RRT check object on object collisions aswell.
- Simplify functions for easy control flows and make rendering controlled by main
